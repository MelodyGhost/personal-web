# Personal Website

This repository is home to my [website's](https://www.michael-hall.me) code.

The website itself uses NextJS, Chakra-UI, and TypeScript and is a place to show off my other projects. The core of the website is finished, but there are some changes I would like to make (see TODOs), additionally, it will constantly be updated with new projects, or pages if I want to add them :).
